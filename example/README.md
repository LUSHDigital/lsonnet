# lsonnet example code

In its current state, lsonnet expects a particular folder structure and named
files. Therefore, please find an example directory here with a sample file
structure and a few example templates and tests.

You can use `lsonnet test` and `lsonnet validate` to see how this all works and
how it is returned.
